# predicting potability of drinking water

### The model predicts the potability of water based on the following chemical and physical components:
- turbidity	
- Trihalomethanes	
- Organic_carbon	
- Conductivity	
- Sulfate
- Chloramines	
- TDS	
- Hardness

#### Check out https://github.com/chiru30/predicting-potability/blob/main/Data/Permissible_limits_potability dataset which has permissible limits of all the components mentioned above and has been categorised to TRUE- risk and FALSE -no risk values . 

## Best model accuracy so far :
- Random Forest Classifier - ACCURACY : 65.209%
## Correct Prediction by :
- Random Forest Classifier , Support Vector Machine , Bagging Classifier models

#### **As Random Forest Classifier has the best accuracy so far and also is predicting correctly we will go with this particular model**
